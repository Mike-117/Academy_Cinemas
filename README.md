# Academy Cinemas
This is a webpage for a local movie theater, which displays its current showings. I created it with the intent of using Bootstrap CSS for the styling. I used a jumbotron for the header, and the movies are arranged as cards in a card-deck. There is a navigation bar at the top which takes the user to the different sections of the page.

I included a popover sign-up sheet for receiving special movie deals, and an email form for rewards membership to the cinema. All the styling and functionality are on a single page, using Bootstrap, jquery, and popper.js.
